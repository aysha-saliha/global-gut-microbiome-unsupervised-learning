Unsupervised Machine Learning–Based Clustering and Visualization of Global Gut Microbiome Profiles



The human gut microbiome plays a crucial role in metabolism, immunity, and overall host health, yet its large-scale population structure remains difficult to characterize due to the high dimensionality and complexity of microbiome datasets. Traditional supervised approaches often rely on predefined labels, which may obscure intrinsic microbial patterns.



This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to large-scale global gut microbiome datasets to identify natural structure and reproducible microbial community patterns without prior assumptions. Dimensionality reduction and clustering approaches were used to explore variation across samples and to visualize high-dimensional microbial profiles in a biologically interpretable manner.



The analysis revealed three distinct gut microbiome clusters, each characterized by dominant microbial taxa and community-level differences. These clusters reflect reproducible population-level microbiome profiles and highlight the utility of exploratory, data-driven methods for understanding microbiome heterogeneity at a global scale.



This work emphasizes the importance of balancing analytical rigor with biological interpretability and provides a scalable computational framework for microbiome exploration, with potential relevance to population health studies and personalized medicine.
